Release 1.0.0:

+ parallelization of kdci, lcm and aim
+ use kdci for mining F2

Release 0.8.0:

+ implement local pruning for computing F2

Release 0.7.5

+ optimization: use an UT matrix of size |F| for 2-items computation and
  communication

Release 0.7.4
+ implement parallel GPVS (best of all)
+ various improvements to build subsystem

Release 0.7.1
+ fix long-standing fp-growth* bug: there was a simple bug in txn prune code
  which added extra items to transactions before inserting to fp-tree!
+ use non-blocking send routines instead of the more primitive _init
  routines to implement AABC and AAPC operations

Release 0.5.2
+ too many changes to list :)
+ two-way partitioning
+ corected fp-growth algorithm

Release 0.1.2

+ prune transactions (|t_i|<3) while partitioning

Release 0.1.0

+ find 2-items in parallel with tree based LAM reduce code
+ provide faster method for iteration in Mtx_Graph
+ optimize 2-items: use upper triangular matrix for representing graph
+ reorg: separate db, 2-items and part code to libs cleanly.
+ compute inverse map when translating to metis graph
+ a vertex separator adapter that translates sep in metis graph to orig graph
+ use the separator in F
