	noclique - a parallel frequency mining tool for sparse problems

parfreq implements a generic parallel frequency mining algorithm that can
use any serial mining algorithm in its concurrent mining step on each
processor. This implementation uses MPI as the message passing 
subsystem and supports FP-Growth* for the serial mining algorithm, as 
well as kDCI, AIM and LCM. The best parallelization is kDCI. Serial kDCI 
is also used for mining F2 in parallel which is necessary for the item 
distribution.

parallel aim and fp-growth can achieve tremendous speedups. to verify
the correctness of the outputs produced you can use two scripts under
bin count-patterns.py which breaks down the frequent item sets by
length and merge-patterns.py which you can use to combine the patterns
output on different processors. the easiest way to test is to simulate
a parallel computer on a single processor using MPI.
