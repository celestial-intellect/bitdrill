* inflated times in T20.I6.6000K and others

  explanation: hardware failure: it seems some hardware failure or
  some guy running processes in the middle of my runs messed up the
  entire results.

* improved run times after one run in T40.I8.4000K

  linux fs cache: might make the algo run better in the next run
  it seems. not sure. seems to have happened with T40.I8.4000K but on
  second thought, looks impossible since i thought i saw an improvement
  in the mining phase, data is generated dynamically there...
